## Hi, I'm Chris <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

I live in New Zealand and work in the data analytics and data science space. I am also a mentor at Data Science Dream Job.

I thrive in environments where I can bridge the gap between business and analytics/data science/technology ([read about purple profiles])(https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/purple-people-at-the-heart-of-cognitive-tech-1452142924).

I trust that you'll find some fun examples of data science and cloud projects here including end to end deployment ML pipeline.

:mailbox: Feedback appreciated, don't hesitate to reach out out!
